# HomeMeal App Authentication and Navigation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. Authentication token refresh failures
2. Row-level security policy violation for wallet creation
3. Improper navigation flow without loading screens
4. Layout warning from Expo Router tabs
5. Inconsistent image handling in food components
6. Missing systematic approach to security policy implementation

## Solutions Implemented

1. Created a robust AuthProvider that properly handles authentication state and session management
2. Implemented proper wallet creation with fallback mechanisms
3. Added loading screens and improved navigation flow
4. Fixed tab layout to properly handle conditional tab display
5. Added documentation for database security policies
6. Expanded security policies for all tables in the application
7. Created utility functions for consistent image handling
8. Developed a comprehensive security implementation checklist

## Components Updated

1. **AuthProvider**: Created a new provider that manages authentication state, user roles, and onboarding flow
2. **Root Layout**: Simplified to use the new AuthProvider
3. **Tabs Layout**: Updated to conditionally show tabs based on user role
4. **Verification Screen**: Modified to skip wallet creation during initial signup
5. **Loading Screen**: Created a reusable component for consistent loading screens
6. **FoodItem & ChefFoodCard**: Enhanced with robust image handling and fallback mechanisms
7. **Utility Helpers**: Created imageHelpers.ts for centralized image handling logic

## Security Policies Updated

### Comprehensive RLS Policies:

- Added policies for all 17 tables in the application
- Implemented role-based access control for each table
- Created specific policies for different operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Added service role policies for automated processes

### Key Security Improvements:

1. Fixed wallet creation flow to respect RLS policies
2. Added proper policies for role-specific tables (makers, delivery_boys)
3. Added granular control for order status updates
4. Implemented chat privacy policies
5. Created selective access for ratings and reviews
6. Added admin-specific policies for monitoring

## Image Handling Improvements

1. **Centralized Utility Functions**:

   - `getValidImageUrl()`: Processes and validates image URLs
   - `getImagePlaceholderProps()`: Provides consistent fallback styling and icons

2. **Component Enhancements**:

   - Added loading states for images
   - Implemented error handling for missing/invalid images
   - Created visually appealing placeholders based on food categories
   - Added loading indicators during image fetching

3. **Storage Structure Updates**:
   - Simplified bucket structure (profiles and food-images)
   - Clarified folder organization within buckets
   - Updated documentation to reflect current implementation
   - Restricted food image uploads to admin users only

## Additional Steps Required

1. Apply all RLS policies in Supabase dashboard for each table as documented in `project-docs/Database-Security.md` and follow the `Security-Implementation-Checklist.md`

2. Test all policies with different user roles:

   - Unauthenticated user
   - Customer
   - Maker (Chef)
   - Delivery boy
   - Admin
   - Service role

3. Test the authentication flow thoroughly to ensure no more errors occur

4. Verify image handling in all relevant screens and components

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. User signs up with phone number
2. Basic user record is created in the `users` table
3. User is directed to role selection
4. After role selection, wallet is created
5. User completes location setup and profile setup
6. User is directed to the main app tabs

### Wallet Creation

Wallet creation now happens:

- After role selection (in the role selection screen)
- With a fallback in the AuthProvider if it wasn't created earlier
- With proper error handling to continue the flow even if creation fails

### Loading States

- Added proper loading indicators
- Implemented delay when navigating between screens
- Created a dedicated LoadingScreen component

### Tab Navigation

- Tabs now properly appear/disappear based on user role
- Fixed duplicate styling issues in the tab layout
- Using the AuthProvider to determine user role instead of fetching it separately

### Security Best Practices

- Start with restrictive policies and add exceptions as needed
- Use transactions when creating related records
- Implement retry mechanisms for critical operations
- Test all policies with different user roles

### Image Handling Best Practices

- Always check for valid image URLs before rendering
- Provide consistent fallback experiences for missing images
- Include loading states for better user experience
- Use appropriate error boundaries to prevent component crashes
- Implement lazy loading for better performance
