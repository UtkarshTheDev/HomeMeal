## Animation Component Improvements - Done

Created helper hooks and components to improve animation handling across the application:

1. Created `useAnimatedSafeValue` hook that safely manages Reanimated shared values and prevents the "Reading from 'value' during component render" warning.

2. Created `AnimatedSafeView` component that safely manages layout animations and prevents warnings about properties being overwritten by layout animations.

3. Updated meal creation screens (`meal-creation.tsx` and `meal-type-foods.tsx`) to use these new components, ensuring animations work properly without warnings.

These improvements make the UI more performant and prevent React Native Reanimated warnings in the application.

## AI Meal Planning Integration - In Progress

Implementing AI-powered meal planning with Llama model through Akash Chat API:

1. Created a service to interact with the Akash Chat API for generating meal plans based on user prompts.

2. Designed an interactive dialog interface for users to input meal preferences and refine AI suggestions.

3. Implemented a JSON parser to convert AI-generated meal plans into app-compatible data structures.

4. Added ability for users to iterate on AI suggestions until satisfied with the generated meal plan.

5. Integrated the AI-generated meal plan with the existing meal creation workflow.

This feature enhances the user experience by providing intelligent, personalized meal planning assistance while maintaining the app's intuitive workflow.
