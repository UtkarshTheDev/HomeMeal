## Animation Component Improvements - Done

Created helper hooks and components to improve animation handling across the application:

1. Created `useAnimatedSafeValue` hook that safely manages Reanimated shared values and prevents the "Reading from 'value' during component render" warning.

2. Created `AnimatedSafeView` component that safely manages layout animations and prevents warnings about properties being overwritten by layout animations.

3. Updated meal creation screens (`meal-creation.tsx` and `meal-type-foods.tsx`) to use these new components, ensuring animations work properly without warnings.

These improvements make the UI more performant and prevent React Native Reanimated warnings in the application.
